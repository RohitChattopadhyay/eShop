Design an online apparel store using servlets. The store keeps records for its items in a database where
some items may be discounted and some other items should be displayed as “new arrivals”. A user may
search for a specific item. By default, when a user signs in, based on his/her profile (male/female etc.),
show him/her preferred set of clothing. Users will be divided into two groups: some users looking for
discounted items mainly, some others looking for new arrivals. So, depending on their preference already
set in the database, their shopping experience would be different.
You may apply the concept of session and cookies for tracking user behaviour. You may use
SessionListener and/or ServletContextListener. Database connectivity code should not be hardcoded in
any servlet.
